## :muscle: The project: My Fitness Journey

As a fitness and gym lover I feel the need to build an app to track all of my growing and training journey.

It's a personal project that allow the users to create their training programs or, as my case, to report the training programs the personal trainer create for me, and track the progress through the time.

I believe this app has an incredible hidden potetial. Just thinking to the possibility to add a lot of new and usefull functionality to fulfill all the needs of the people who live the fitness's world

Try now my app: [**My Fitness Journey**](https://my-fitness-journey.netlify.app/)
